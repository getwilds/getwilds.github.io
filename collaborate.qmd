Are you a data-driven researcher looking to share your data and discoveries in
a web application, bring more automation to your science, or transform analysis
scripts into software, but you lack the time, resources, or skills in your
group? Let us help!
*WILDS Collaborative Projects* is our flagship partnership program. We work
directly with researchers, principal investigators, and staff at Fred Hutch to
co-design and build software tools that solve real-world scientific and
operational challenges. **This opportunity is provided at no
cost** to the teams we choose to partner with. We are happy to discuss a
potential collaboration with anyone at Fred Hutch.

## How to get started

1. Email us at `wilds@fredhutch.org` to express your interest.
2. We will send you an intake form to describe your idea in more detail.
3. We will then schedule a call to discuss your project goals and feasibility.
4. Together, we will develop a project proposal for approval.

Once the project proposal is approved by you and our leadership team, projects
typically **last three to eight months**, depending on scope.

## What projects are a good fit for WILDS Collaborative Projects?

We are more likely to be open to an opportunity to collaborate if the project
you have in mind fits one or more of the following criteria:

- The deliverables of the collaboration have potential applications beyond an
individual lab or group, better yet if the potential value can extend beyond
Fred Hutch.
- The project will produce open source deliverables (e.g. Python or R packages),
the project enables the
distribution of open source or open license resources (e.g. datasets, websites),
or the project leverages open source technologies.
- Project deliverables include software packages written in Python or R that
will be widely distributed.
- The project leads to or includes the development of websites or interactive
web applications that promote [Fred Hutch's Strategic Priorities][fh-strat].
- The project can be well-scoped, meaning the deliverables and requirements can
be defined in detail, and success can be clearly evaluated.

## What to expect from a collaboration

WILDS Collaborative Projects are designed to be **focused, time-bound
partnerships**. Our typical contributions include:

- **3–8 months** of collaboration time, depending on project complexity.
- A **dedicated WILDS software, data scientist, or user experience researcher**
contributing roughly **20% effort**.
- Support for co-design, development, testing, and documentation of your
software, web application, website, or resource.
- Regular check-ins and progress reviews with your research team.

We prioritize projects that we can complete and deliver within that window
rather than those requiring ongoing software maintenance or multi-year
development. We are open to, although we cannot commit to in advance, iterations
on prior collaborations that include maintenance work.

## What might *not* be a good fit

To make the most of this opportunity, we generally do not select projects that:

- Require creating a data analysis or models that describe patterns in a dataset.
However, if you consistently receive hard to parse data, or you need to
visualize the same data periodically, we could support you in building software
to streamline your analysis.
- Include building online computing platforms, where users could access high
performance computing resources, or where users could upload their data for
long term storage. We are happy to direct you to existing computing platforms
that may fit your needs.

## Continuous proposal review

This is an **ongoing call for proposals** and there is no specific deadline. We
review ideas and start new collaborations throughout the year.

Ultimately, our goal is to build tools and resources that others can reuse,
contribute to, and grow. By working together, we hope to create resources
and software that supports research at Fred Hutch and amplifies our impact
across the broader scientific community. Our team is excited to learn about your
needs and ideas so we can explore what we can build together.
