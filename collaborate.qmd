Are you a data-driven researcher looking to share your data and discoveries in
a web application, bring more automation to your science, or tranform analysis
scripts into software, but you lack the time, resources, or skills in your
group? Let us help!
*WILDS Collaborative Projects* is our flagship partnership program. We work
directly with researchers, principal investigators, and staff at Fred Hutch to
co-design and build software tools that solve real-world scientific and
operational challenges. **This opportunity is provided at no
cost** to the teams we choose to partner with. We are happy to discuss a
potential collaboration with anyone at Fred Hutch.

The first step is to reach
out to express your interest by sending us an email at `wilds@fredhutch.org`.
After you reach out, we will send you an intake form where you can
describe your idea for collaboration in detail, and we will schedule a call
where we will discuss the contents of that form. We will then work together
to write a project proposal, and once you and our leadership approves the
proposal we can get started working together. Typically, our
collaborative projects last three to eight months once we agree on the project
scope.

What projects are a good fit for WILDS Collaborative Projects?
We are more likely to be open to an opportunity to collaborate if the project
you have in mind fits one or more of the following criteria:

- The deliverables of the collaboration have potential applications beyond an
individual lab or group, better yet if the potential value can extend beyond
Fred Hutch.
- The project will produce open source deliverables (e.g. Python or R packages),
the project enables the
distribution of open source or open license resources (e.g. datasets), or the
project leverages open source technologies.
- Project deliverables include software packages written in Python or R that
will be widely distributed.
- The project leads to or includes the development of websites or interactive
web applications that promote [Fred Hutch's Strategic Priorities][fh-strat].
- The project can be well-scoped, meaning the deliverables and requirements can be
defined in detail, and success can be clearly evaluated.

Ultimately, our goal is to build tools and resources that others can reuse,
contribute to, and grow. By working together, we hope to create resources
and software that supports research at Fred Hutch and amplifies our impact
across the broader scientific community. Our team is excited to learn about your
needs and ideas so we can explore what we can build together.
