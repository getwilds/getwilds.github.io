Therefore to encourage open science practices and to cultivate the development of open source software at Fred Hutch, the Data Science Lab (DaSL) created WILDS, the open source software office of the Fred Hutch Cancer Center. WILDS stands for Workflows Integrating Large Data and Software, which highlights our focus on people in their day-to-day scientific work. The mission of WILDS includes the following:\n\nEngage with the Cancer Consortium community about how they can adopt open science practices into their own workflows.\nEducate our community about the critical role that open source software plays in biomedical data science practice.\nSupport open source software developers across the Cancer Consortium.\nElevate the quality of open-source software being developed at Fred Hutch.\nEmpower new open-source developers by evangelizing best practices and catalyzing community around the open-source software development process.\nConnect developers, researchers, and providers to opportunities to share, academically publish, and publicize their software.\nCollaborate within the Fred Hutch community to build the next generation of open-source software tools.\n\n\n\n\nTo support our mission, WILDS is actively engaged in the following activities:\n\nWe maintain, distribute, and publish open source scientific software, mostly implemented in the Python and R ecosystems.\nWe maintain and distribute open source scientific workflows implemented in WDL or Nextflow.\nWe develop research compendia to demonstrate common data analyses and how they can best be organized and shared.\nWe package and develop Docker recipes and Dockerfiles so that researchers can run pipelines in consistent computing environments.\nWe create and maintain documentation about how to use and contribute to WILDS resources.\nWe co-sponsor and create materials for DaSLâ€™s Community Studios.\n\nAll of these open source resources are designed for researchers to either use off-the-shelf or as tools and templates that they can adapt into their own work.
