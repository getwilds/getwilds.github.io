## We would be happy to help you with WILDS

If you would like to ask a question about any WILDS projects, do not hesitate to
email us at `wilds@fredhutch.org`. If you are a developer or you are familiar
with GitHub, you can also open an issue on the GitHub repository that 
corresponds to the project you are interested in: <https://github.com/getwilds/>.
For example, if you have an issue or question with the [sixtyfour][] package, 
open an issue in the issue tracker for that project at 
<https://github.com/getwilds/sixtyfour/issues>.

If you are a Fred Hutch employee or you work for one of the organizations in the 
[Cancer Consortium][ccon] please schedule a [Data House Call][dhc] and mention
WILDS in the booking.

[sixtyfour]: https://github.com/getwilds/sixtyfour/
[ccon]: https://www.cancerconsortium.org/
