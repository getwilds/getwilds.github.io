## DASL Guide

We maintain the [WILDS Contributor Guide][guide] as a collection of guidelines,
review criteria, and best practices for developing production-ready WDL and 
Nextflow workflows, research compendia, Docker files and software.

Our goal in developing the WILDS Contributor Guide is not just limitted to the
care and keeping of WILDS, we hope it can serve as a model for research or
software development groups in terms of how they think about code and software
quality.

If you would like to make a contribution to any DaSL WILDS projects please open
